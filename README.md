## Project overview
This iOS project consists of one UIViewController that inspired by Anton Aheichanka's design in Dribbble [here](https://dribbble.com/shots/1928064-Secret-Project). Also, I've used one of [bigmountainstudio](https://github.com/bigmountainstudio/Xcode-Templates) template to easy customize views.
